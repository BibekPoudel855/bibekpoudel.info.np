          <p>
            The watch industry has dominated the market in today's generation. Especially the digital and smartwatch. In
            past generation
            people wear traditional mechanical watch in that time there is no digital and smartwatch so the watch
            industry has only
            mechanical watch but in today's generation people are wearing
            digital and smatchwatch so the supply of mechanical watch
            is decreasing day by day. The customer has a trend to wear digital and smartwatch because of technology.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Smartwatches has been emerged day by day. It has been the most valuable thing in watch industry.
            Everyone is using smartwatch in today's world. Companies like Samsung, Apple, Garmin etc have developed
            system like fitness training tracker, heartrate monitor, navigator, bloodpressure checker etc in smartwatch
            . Watch industry are using technology in order to sell smartwatch. They are using online advertisement to
            promote their product. They also announce new feature to promote and sell their products.

          <p>
            Technology has made this world advanced which also affects in watch design and sales so because of that
            smartwatch and
            digital watch is selling more and more in this time. In past time the evolution of watch has begin in 16th
            century. In
            that time people use portable drum watch with sundial. It is used by ancient Hindu and Arabic people. When
            time goes on
            the quality watch has been built by engineers. In 17th century european engineers invented mechanical watch
            which we use
            today their sales was more in that time as it is the best invention of watch design but it is not accurate
            and it needs
            more cleaning as it can be dirty at anytime.</p>
          <p>In 1969 the quartz watch has been invented and it is far better than mechanical
            watch in 17th century as it has numerial number with accurate time and it is hard to make it unworkable and
            dirty. The sales
            of quartz watch is more and more at that time many quartz watch was been sold at expensive price making
            profit to the seller
            and producer but shortly in 1974 the digital watch was invented by Pulsar. The digital watch has digital
            numbers like 1 to 12
            and it doesnot have pins which moves in clockwise direction. It shows the time directly in digital watch as
            it is the best
            watch at that time. The sales of digital watch at that time is unbreakable as there are many people who want
            the digital watch
            as it is the best watch at that time. Digital watch was expensive when it first came out. Digital watch is
            still used today.
            In 1998 the first smartwatch was invented named Seipko Ruputer it is the first smartwatch which has digital
            time and weather.
            In that time no other watch has that technology. It is most expensive watch at that time and also today. The
            sales of smartwatch
            is more as many people wants to buy the smartwatch but the todays generation smartwatch and in that time
            smartwatch is different
            as todays generation smartwatch has everything like fitness tracker, navigator, bloodpressure checker etc
            but that time smartwatch
            was firstly introduced. Smartwatches has been emerged day by day. It has been the most valuable thing in
            watch industry.
            Everyone is using smartwatch in today's world. Companies like Samsung, Apple, Garmin etc have developed
            system like fitness training
            tracker, heartrate monitor, navigator, bloodpressure checker etc in smartwatch. So technological advancement
            change the design and sales
            of watch and watch industry.
